<blockquote>
  <p>DOCUMENTAL RESEARCH - CONTRACTS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documents obtained during the research were organized in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgf7gIHUV5rWU2o_RNyCwJ0uFGC2mwDoBWUED1E0v-w/edit#gid=0">repository to allow public access</a>. Each governmental sphere is indicated in a row containing the following information: state/federal unit (UF), local, population (according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE), link to the citizens online information service (e-SIC) and link to the folder in which the documents are stored. All the documents obtained by the research team, such as contracts, Official Gazettes excerpts, opinions and other documents regarding the technologies are in each indicated folder.</p>

<p>There were 5 categories created to quantify the access to documents and information about the contracts:</p>

      <p>From the 253 technologies mapped out, the documentation of 141 (54.94%) of them could not be found, either by FOIA request, or search in transparency portal or Google engine or Official Gazettes. The contracts were obtained only in 72 cases (28.46%), while 19 (7.51%) had Official Gazettes excerpts. 21 technologies (8.30%) were developed internally by the public agencies and 2 cases (0.79%) had no formalization.</p>
