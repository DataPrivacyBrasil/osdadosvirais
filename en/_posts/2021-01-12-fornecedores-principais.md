        <p>In Loco, currently called Incognia, was the most prominent company as a supplier of technology in the pandemic (18.6%) due to the offering of a Social Isolation Rate that was implemented in 47 locations all around the country. Then, with a large margin of difference in relation to the In Loco, appear, ABR Telecom and Instituto D’or de Ensino de Pesquisa, with 8 and 7 locations implementing their technologies (corresponding to 3.2% and 2.8% of the cases, respectively). In 49.8% of the cases identified, the suppliers presented their product in only one location. Therefore, apart from In Loco’s case, the supply of technology in Brazil was very dispersed among a vast range of suppliers, instead of being centered in a handful of players. </p>
