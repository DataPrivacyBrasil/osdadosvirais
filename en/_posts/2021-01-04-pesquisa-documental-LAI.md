> DOCUMENTAL RESEARCH - CONTRACTS

The documents obtained during the research were organized in a [repository to allow public access](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgf7gIHUV5rWU2o_RNyCwJ0uFGC2mwDoBWUED1E0v-w/edit#gid=0). Each governmental sphere is indicated in a row containing the following information: state/federal unit (UF), local, population (according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE), link to the citizens online information service (e-SIC) and link to the folder in which the documents are stored. All the documents obtained by the research team, such as contracts, Official Gazettes excerpts, opinions and other documents regarding the technologies are in each indicated folder.

There were 5 categories created to quantify the access to documents and information about the contracts:
