> During the pandemic...

...the use of smartphone apps became more prevalent as it served as a means to access public services.

From the mapped technologies, there were 28 initiatives to fight against COVID-19 that used apps. The use of these applications in mobile gadgets demands that the user grants many permissions of access to resources or data from the device, such as location, microfone, gallery storage and even calls.

Some of those permissions can represent a risk in terms of personal data protection or information security if the resources are used by malicious agents or for secondary purposes not consented by the user.
