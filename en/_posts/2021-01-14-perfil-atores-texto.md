Beyond the general categories of suppliers and developers, the team created categories to better define the different profiles of these players. This classification aimed to identify and distinguish the different levels of participation of public and private players in the scenario of technology development and supply, as well as evaluate the relations established in this process.

Categories - player profile:


| Private companies                        | National or foreign profit-making companies.                                                                                                                                  
| Non-profit private entities   | Includes the remaining organizations such as foundations, associations, class entities, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Public companies                        | Includes both public companies of which the State is the sole shareholder and public companies with open stock, as long as the State has major control. This choice was made to avoid an excessive number of categories and help in the visualization of the types of players.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Public agencies                            | Corresponds to the agencies or public bodies in the direct and indirect State Administration, such as departments, foundations, autarchies and other agencies under the public law regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Public higher education institutions | It includes public universities and federal institutes. Although the institutions mentioned can be legally considered autarchies, that is, a public body , the separation motive lies in the interest to determine if this sector (academic) is contributing with the development and/or supply of technology besides the academic contribution. |
| Private higher education institutions | It corresponds to the private universities. This separation from other private entities has the same criteria adopted in the case of the public higher education institutions, but with enfasis in the private sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
