> PLAYERS

During the analysis, it was observed that it is not always that the player supplying the technology to the public sector is also responsible for its development.  In order to identify the different roles of each player, they were divided in the following categories:


| Suppliers   | The players responsible for supplying the product or service directly to the users.                                              |
| Developers | The players responsible for the direct conception and development of a determined technology or platform in which the service is provided. |

These categories are not excludent of each other, that is to say that the same player can be classified in both of them.
