        <p>In Loco (Incognia) and ABR Telecom (together with the telecommunication providers Claro, Oi, Vivo and Tim) are suppliers but also developers of two different Social Isolation Rates. Thus, both In Loco (Incognia) and ABR Telecom lead the list of developers identified at 8.6% and 3.2% respectively.</p>
        <p>An important aspect to highlight in the results regarding developers is that in 8,3% (the second biggest rate) of the technologies mapped the team was unable to  identify the developer. This result is indicative of flaws in the fulfilment of the transparency principle regarding the disclosure of information related to the technologies implemented by the public sector in the country.</p>
        <p>A new observation made based on the results about developers is the presence of Dahua, a Chinese multinational company, that appeared as the third company with the most reach (2.8%), corresponding to 8 of all the cases mapped out. The results of Dahua are related to the offering of thermographic cameras used during the pandemic to measure body temperature. Part of these cameras measure temperature using facial recognition technologies. Since fever is one of the main symptoms associated with COVID-19, the application of these cameras has the purpose of identifying possible individuals infected with the virus. Hikvision, another Chinese multinational company manufacturer of thermographic cameras, appears in the results at 2% of the total of developers, corresponding to 6 of the mapped cases. Like Dahua’s cameras, Hikvision’s cameras measure temperature with facial recognition technology and are capable of doing this procedure even if there is a high number of people passing by, at a distance, and also in real time.</p>
